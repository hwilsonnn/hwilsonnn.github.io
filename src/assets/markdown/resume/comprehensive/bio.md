At Trade Ledger, I began as an intern with the intention of gaining work experience. My significant contributions during my internship in combination with my potential let to my part time employment as a software engineer role whilst I was still at university.

During my time at Trade Ledger I have transitioned from a more QA Software Developer position, to an SDET position, and then to find my place as a Frontend Engineer. During my time as an FE Engineer, I went from being the youngest and least experienced in a team of 5+ FE Engineers, to the sole FE engineer at Trade Ledger.

I was the **sole FE developer at Trade Ledger for over a year**. Within that time, not only did I solely deliver customer critical FE items, but I was the point of contact for the entire business for the FE. This experience meant I learnt a significant amount about best practices, prioritisation, decision-making, leadership, and being able to manage the responsibilities of being the lead FE developer.
