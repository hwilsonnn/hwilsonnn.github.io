My intentions for this site is to showcase some of my FE development skills in both practice and as text. As a FE developer it _feels_ important to have a website, especially when you are looking for a job (which was the primary reason for this site's creation).

My original goal with this site was to have a hosted place for my resume, and also some place to show my react development skills. I achieved that very early on as I effectively only needed to show my resume in a HTML format. But I wanted to have a bit of fun in the process and try out some new tools and techniques that I haven't used extensively before.

In the long term I would like to see this site grow in it's content and general functionality. It should act like a playground for libraries I want to try out or changes in the FE/javascript space that look interesting. Scope creep will always be an issue for passion projects, but that just means that there is a lot to play around with!
